# twitter-custom-styles
A custom stylesheet for Twitter.com for Stylebot.

1. Install [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha)
2. Copy everything in style.css
3. Open Stylebot and click on "advanced"
4. Paste everything

I'm happy about enhancements and issues, as it's very much WIP
